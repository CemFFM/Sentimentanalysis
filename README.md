# Sentimentanalysis
A mixture of the best sentimentanalyisis tools on github for users with linguistical background.


This is a mixture of the best #free twitter sentimentanalysis modules on github.
I took the most usable codes and mixed them into one because most of them
where for a linguistical search not usable and did not show a retweet, a full tweet
no output as csv, only few informations of a tweet, switching language
or not even to compare linguistic features in tweets of two different langauges and etc. etc. ...
special and many many thanks to https://github.com/vprusso/youtube_tutorials who showed on his
page a tutorial on how to do a sentimentanalysis with python.

I did this for users with not much programming skills but linguistical background to help them to get a corpus of twitterdata
and to show/explain them how to do a comparison between sentence based vs document based sentimentanalysis
Credits to all AVAILABLE FREE AND SIMPLE sentimentanalysis programms (dec. 2019) on github.
Many thanks to everybody and of course to github for making this exchange and usage possible!
