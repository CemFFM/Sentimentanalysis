# Sentimentanalysis
A mixture of the best sentimentanalyisis tools on github for users with linguistical background.


This is a mixture of the best #free twitter sentimentanalysis modules on github (dec 2019).
I took the most usable codes and mixed them into one, because most of them
were for a linguistical search not usable and did not show a retweet, a full tweet (very important)
no output as csv, only few informations of a tweet, switching language
or not even to compare linguistic features in tweets of two different langauges and etc. etc. ...
special and many many thanks to https://github.com/vprusso/youtube_tutorials who showed on his
page a tutorial on how to do a sentimentanalysis with python.

I did this for users with not much programming skills but linguistical background to help them to get a corpus of twitterdata
and to show/explain them how to do a comparison between sentence based vs document based sentimentanalysis.
